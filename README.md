### Description

IF you use hot or not .. this will get you TONS of matches. you simply login and then hit start. It flips through showing you pictures and keywords of your potential matches all while 'clicking yes' that you want to meet them. I used it for a couple hours and have over 300 matches. Its alot easier to just delete people you dont want to meet, than to look for ones you want to meet, click yes and hope they click yes back !
